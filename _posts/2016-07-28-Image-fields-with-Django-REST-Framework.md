`A complete example that illustrates how to implement image uploads and models with image fields with Django REST Framework`

## Introduction
Not long ago we had to implement a Django site that exposes an API using Django REST Framework. Through this API we gave access to the users to models that had image fields on them. Although the problem is pretty simple, all we could find were disjointed examples that showed how to implement a solution. We wrote this blogpost to provide a complete example that shows how to handle image uploads and image fields using a Django REST Framework API.  

## The code
The code for this blogpost is available on GitHub. A Vagrant configuration file is included if you want to test the service yourself.  

## The model
Out example has only one class that represents the typical “User Profile” use case on a Django site:  

```python
def upload_to(instance, filename):
    return 'user_profile_image/{}/{}'.format(instance.user_id, filename)


class UserProfile(models.Model):
    GENDER_UNKNOWN = 'U'
    GENDER_MALE = 'M'
    GENDER_FEMALE = 'F'
    GENDER_CHOICES = (
        (GENDER_UNKNOWN, _('unknown')),
        (GENDER_MALE, _('male')),
        (GENDER_FEMALE, _('female')),
    )

    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, primary_key=True)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField(_('date of birth'), blank=True, null=True)
    phone_number = PhoneNumberField(_('phone number'), blank=True)
    gender = models.CharField(_('gender'), max_length=1, choices=GENDER_CHOICES, default=GENDER_UNKNOWN)
    image = models.ImageField(_('image'), blank=True, null=True, upload_to=upload_to)
```

With the exception of the phone_number field (which uses django-phonenumber-field), the rest of the fields are regular Django fields, including the image which is the subject of this project and represents an image for the associated user.  

## The API
As with all Django REST Framework APIs, we need to define serializers, views (or viewsets) and hook the views in the site’s URLs. Let’s start with the serializers:  

```python
class UserProfileSerializer(HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = UserProfile
        fields = ('url', 'date_of_birth', 'phone_number', 'gender', 'image')
        readonly_fields = ('url', 'image')
```

It couldn’t be simpler. UserProfileSerializer it’s just a HyperlinkedModelSerializer that handles the UserProfile model. Given that it is not possible to handle uploads using the default JSON parser, we marked the image field as read-only.  

The views are a little more interesting:  

```python
class UserProfileViewSet(RetrieveModelMixin, UpdateModelMixin, GenericViewSet):
    queryset = UserProfile.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserProfileSerializer
    permission_classes = (IsAdminOrIsSelf,)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    @detail_route(methods=['POST'], permission_classes=[IsAdminOrIsSelf])
    @parser_classes((FormParser, MultiPartParser,))
    def image(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        if 'upload' in request.data:
            user_profile = self.get_object()
            user_profile.image.delete()

            upload = request.data['upload']

            user_profile.image.save(upload.name, upload)

            return Response(status=HTTP_201_CREATED, headers={'Location': user_profile.image.url})
        else:
            return Response(status=HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

We have a GenericViewSet combined with RetrieveModelMixin and UpdateModelMixin to provide retrieve and update funcionality for our UserProfile model (It doesn’t make sense to provide list or destroy in this context). The interesting part is the image method, which is exposed as a view using @detail_route decorator.  

The trick here is that the method is also decorated using @parser_classes where we declare that the requests should be parsed using FormParser or MultiPartParser, and this is what is going to allow us to handle the uploaded files.  

When the method is invoked, we check that the request data contains an upload entry, and if it does we delete the image associated with the user profile, replace it with the UploadedFile contents and return a Response with status code 201 (Created). If upload is not in the request data, we return a fail response with status 400 (Bad Request).  

The last part is to set up the URLs for our API:  

```python
router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'user_profiles', UserProfileViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    url(r'^', include(router.urls)),
    url(r'^o/', include('oauth2_provider.urls', namespace='oauth2_provider')),
]
```

We used a Django REST Framework Router which wires everything automatically and thus save us a lot of work. Notice that we’re also using Django OAuth Toolkit to provide authentication for our API.  

## Usage
The following session illustrates the typical usage of our API.  

```
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --header "Accept: application/json; indent=4" --request POST --data "username=admin&password=admin&client_id=zmfZyf7EAGJJ6imph3qtwGtoH8eqt1VdVmRZh7NC&grant_type=password" http://localhost:8000/o/token/; echo

    "date_of_birth": "2015-07-07",
    "phone_number": "+41524204242",
    "gender": "M",
    "image": "http://localhost:8000/media/user_profile_image/1/admin.png"
}

$ curl --verbose --header "Authorization: Bearer PkwvCYq0cRYfvpJeXvc4czFKvohwea" --header "Accept: application/json; indent=4" --request POST --form upload=@admin2.jpg http://localhost:8000/user_profiles/1/image/; echo

}
```

## Conclusions
As we mentioned before, this problem was actually pretty simple, and it only required know how to wire everything properly in a way that makes sense in the context of Django REST Framework API.
